    <h1><strong>Audience</strong></h1>
    <p>The targeted audience of this project would be generally an adult audience who is interested in learning more about this period of history or exploring the cultural heritage of the island. While we are aware that the Museum currently hosts an array of programs that encourage school aged children to engage with the Museum, we believe that some of the content that would be available in our project may be too mature<br></p>
<p>With that said, we hope that this additional functionality of the website will begin to expand the extent of knowledge that the general public has about apartheid and the mechanisms of disenfranchisement that occurred during this tumultuous period of time. <br></p>
<p>Via the online capabilities of AR, it is essential that we connect the local histories and cultural heritage found on the island with the global consumption of history. Through the stories heard with our project, we believe that it can teach the community to better recognize the signs of oppressive governments and encourage individuals to stand against injustices.</p>
